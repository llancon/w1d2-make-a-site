      <h1>Looking like cubs lately</h1>
      <p>Last game score was Bears 17- Cowboys 31</p>
      <div class="big-font">Hope they comeback <strong>strong</strong></div>

      <p>With a dismal start the Bears have fallen down to 0-3 to begin this season. Jay Cutler is out of the picture for now so the Bears will have to find a new stategy to make a comeback. </p>
      <p>Devin Harris can't carry the team with punt returns and it looks like the defense has a a lot of kinks to work out for now.</p>
      <p>Bears will have to rally for their next game. They will be facing the Lions at home, who have also lost their last game vesus the Greenbay Packers.</p>
      <p>Next game will be have alot at stake because they are playing a same division team. A win would put them even for last place with the Lions.</p>
